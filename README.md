## Features

JavaScript key event codes are numeric values that represent specific keys on a keyboard. Here are the key points about JavaScript key event codes:

There are three main properties used to get information about which key was pressed:

- event.key: Returns a string representing the key value of the pressed key. This is the recommended property to use.
- event.code: Returns a string representing the physical key on the keyboard, regardless of the character it produces
- event.keyCode: Returns a numeric code for the pressed key. This property is deprecated and should be avoided
